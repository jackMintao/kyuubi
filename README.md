Kyuubi is a high-performance universal JDBC and SQL execution engine, built on top of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org).
The goal of Kyuubi is to facilitate users to handle big data like ordinary data.

It provides a standardized JDBC interface with easy-to-use data access in big data scenarios.
End-users can focus on developing their own business systems and mining data value without having to be aware of the underlying big data platform (compute engines, storage services, metadata management, etc.).

Kyuubi relies on Apache Spark to provide high-performance data query capabilities,
and every improvement in the engine's capabilities can help Kyuubi's performance make a qualitative leap.
In addition, Kyuubi improves ad-hoc responsiveness through the engine caching,
and enhances concurrency through horizontal scaling and load balancing.
It provides complete authentication and authentication services to ensure data and metadata security.
It provides robust high availability and load balancing to help you guarantee the SLA commitments.
It provides a two-level elastic resource management architecture to effectively improve resource utilization while covering the performance and response requirements of all scenarios including interactive,
or batch processing and point queries, or full table scans.
It embraces Spark and builds an ecosystem on top of it,
which allows Kyuubi to quickly expand its existing ecosystem and introduce new features,
such as cloud-native support and `Data Lake/Lake House` support.

The vision of Kyuubi is to unify the portal and become an easy-to-use data lake management platform.
Different kinds of workloads, such as ETL processing and BI analytics, can be supported by one platform, using one copy of data, with one SQL interface.

## Aside

The project took its name from a character of a popular Japanese manga - `Naruto`.
The character is named `Kyuubi Kitsune/Kurama`, which is a nine-tailed fox in mythology.
`Kyuubi` spread the power and spirit of fire, which is used here to represent the powerful [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org).
Its nine tails stand for end-to-end multi-tenancy support of this project.
